  meaning: "Meaning: The Justice card indicates that the fairest decision will be
    made. Justice is the sword that cuts through a situation, and will not be swayed
    by outer beauty when deciding what is fair and just.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Fairness, Justice, Cause and effect, Balance and equilibrium,
    Responsibility)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe Justice Tarot card relates to karmic justice,
    legal matters and cause and effect. In a general context Justice is showing you
    that all actions have consequences. This Major Arcana card is also a signifier
    of legal matters being resolved in a fair and balanced matter. This is usually
    a favourable omen if you are involved in a legal dispute. Justice is concerned
    with truth and integrity, so you may find yourself compelled to speak the truth
    and that you more than ever value honesty and integrity in others. \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Lack of accountability, Unfair treatment, Dishonesty, Legal
    flaws, Imbalance)\r\nHistory:\r\nYou may feel you are being victimised or blamed
    for something that is not your fault. Whatever the situation, you must try to
    maintain your balance. Even if you didn\u2019t create the situation, you can choose
    how you react to it and that can be a lesson in itself. Justice in a reversed
    position can also be an indicator of someone trying to avoid their karma. If you
    have played a part in creating your current situation by bad choices or actions,
    you must be accountable. Don\u2019t try to blame others or avoid the consequences,
    just learn from it and move forward a little wiser and more self-aware. The Justice
    Tarot card reversed can also indicate dishonesty. If you have been caught out
    in a lie, don\u2019t try to justify it or lie your way out of it. Just confess,
    accept the consequences and try to draw a line under it. Justice reversed can
    indicate someone with very hard-line or uncompromising views. \r\n"
