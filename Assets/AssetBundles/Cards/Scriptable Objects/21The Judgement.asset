  meaning: "Meaning: This card is referred to as a time of resurrection and awakening,
    a time when a period of our life comes to an absolute end making way for dynamic
    new beginnings.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Decision making, Transition, Renewal, Redemption, Awakening,
    Reincarnation)\r\nHistory:\r\nYou have come through your past karmic lessons with
    increased self-awareness and you are allowing healing to take place so you can
    move forward in a positive direction. If you have a big decision to make when
    this Major Arcana card appears, use the karmic lessons you have learnt from the
    past to help you make the right choice.  Judgement upright can represent a legal
    matter or court case being resolved. If you have acted honourably and told the
    truth, this matter should be resolved in your favour. If you have been dishonest,
    don\u2019t expect things to go your way. You need to clear your conscience and
    try to make amends for your misdeeds. This Major Arcana card can also signify
    being separated from someone you love by an ocean or sea. You can expect to be
    reunited with them soon when it appears. It can also indicate homesickness.\r\n\r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Stagnation, Self-doubt, Poor logic, Poor or hasty judgement)\r\nHistory:\r\nNow
    is the time to take action. If you delay you may lose the opportunities available
    to you. Alternatively, this Major Arcana card in a reversed position can be a
    sign that you may be refusing to learn the karmic lessons of the past. Or you
    may be reproaching yourself for past mistakes so much that you are unable to see
    the lessons to be learned from those mistakes. Judgement reversed can also be
    a sign that you are taking your focus off your own shortcomings by being overly
    critical of others or engaging in malicious gossip. This will only lead you to
    trouble, try to put the focus back on fixing the issues in your own life rather
    than judging other people for their mistakes. \r\n"
