  meaning: "Meaning: The Hermit suggests that you are in a phase of introspection
    where you are drawing your attention inwards and looking for answers within. You
    are in need of a period of inner reflection, away from the current demands of
    your position.\r\n\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Soul-searching, Introspection, Solitude, Withdrawn from society,
    Meditation, Self-reflection)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe Hermit Tarot card in an upright
    position generally indicates that you are entering a period of soul searching,
    self-reflection and spiritual enlightenment. You may find that you need time alone
    to gain a deeper understanding of yourself, to remove yourself from the daily
    grind in order to discover your true spiritual self, contemplate your existence,
    your direction in life or your values. The Hermit can also indicate isolating
    yourself or withdrawing into oneself in order to recover from a difficult situation.
    This Major Arcana trump card can suggest that you may be going through an anti-social
    phase where you just don\u2019t want to interact with people as much as you normally
    would. The Hermit is wise, mature and knowledgeable and may be an indication of
    someone seeking the services of a counsellor or psychiatrist.  This is a time
    to focus on yourself and meeting your own needs.  \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Misfit, Withdrawing from loved ones, Exile, Sadness, Loneliness)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe
    Hermit Tarot card reversed suggests that you have withdrawn too much from the
    world or are becoming too reclusive. Solitude might have been necessary or good
    for you at one point but The Hermit reversed is telling you that it is time to
    come back to the world and the people around you. Taking time for soul-searching
    and self-reflection can be a great thing in moderation but too much can be damaging.
    At some point, you do need to draw a line under things and move forward, this
    Major Arcana card in reversed position indicates that now is that time. It can
    also indicate that you may be feeling shy or apprehensive about being in social
    situations. \r\n\r\n"
  Past: "Just because we live in a world of science and technology doesn\u2019t mean
    we can explain everything. Listen to your gut, it can save you from some nasty
    situations."
  Present: "Being alone isn\u2019t always a negative thing. Take the time to look
    inwards and realize your shortcomings. The first part of becoming better is knowing
    what you lacked in the first place. "
  Future: 'You feel lost and unbalanced right now. Take the time to stop and reevaluate
    your priorities. Future you will thank you for taking the time to think through
    big decisions instead of jumping in head first. '
  RePast: "You never really had many friends. So you carry the feeling of loneliness
    with you like a ball and chain. Don\u2019t let loneliness consume you, it may
    be hard but reach out to someone. Who knows, maybe someone as lonely as you is
    waiting for someone to reach out too."
  RePresent: "Though it is good to be alone in moderation, careful you don\u2019t
    stray into hermit territory. Isolation is a situation that will only lead to dark
    thoughts and nihilistic tendencies. "
  ReFuture: Something tragic will happen to you in the near future. You will withdraw
    from those close to you to seek comfort within. But never forget that there are
    people who love and cherish you.
