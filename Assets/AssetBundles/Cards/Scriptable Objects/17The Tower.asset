  meaning: "Meaning: The Tower is commonly interpreted as meaning danger, crisis,
    destruction, and liberation. It is associated with sudden unforeseen change.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Unexpected change, Renovation, Catastrophe, Destruction, Accident
    or damage)\r\nHistory:\r\nOne positive aspect of The Tower is that the destruction
    it brings is usually directed at something that was built on a false beliefs and
    foundations or unrealistic goals and dreams. Also on the bright side, the destruction
    The Tower brings is always followed by renewal and creation. However, The Tower
    with a negative aspect can represent a whole host of tragic, traumatic or life-altering
    events like the death of a loved one, divorce, a bad breakup, assault, rape, violent
    abuse, stillbirth or miscarriage, child abuse, bankruptcy, a drug overdose, a
    car crash or job loss to name but a few. It\u2019s usually the kind of thing you
    hope will never happen to you. \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Obstacles, Volatile situation, Losses, Illness)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe
    Tower Tarot card reversed can be a sign that you have narrowly avoided a disaster.
    You will need to learn from the experience in order to prevent the lesson from
    coming back around again. It can also signify delaying the inevitable. While we
    would all like to go through life without experiencing hardships, they are a necessary
    part of life. Without darkness how would we ever learn to appreciate the light?
    If you have been running from a big change because you fear the pain or heartache
    it will bring, this Major Arcana card in reversed position may be telling you
    it\u2019s time to turn and face it. Avoiding it may seem like the easier option
    but if you do you\u2019ll be running for the rest of your life. Confronting it
    won\u2019t be easy but it will eventually lead you to a new beginning.  If you
    have already experienced your Tower event, The Tower reversed warns you not to
    try and rebuild what you had but to seek something new and better to build in
    place of what was destroyed as it was destroyed for a reason. \r\n"
  Past: "You revel in the chaos that is everyone else\u2019s life, just make sure
    that you are ready for the chaos in your own."
  Present: You feel your foundations start to crumble underneath you. You have two
    choices, wallow in misery over lost comfort or dive head first into rebuilding.
  Future: Through hardships you have become more resilient to the world around you.
    Take those experiences and reach past your pain to find strength.
  RePast: Just like crying about being left by your parents on the first day of kindergarten,
    your soul screams at the very idea of a world shift.
  RePresent: Just like always carrying an umbrella in case of rain, preparing for
    great changes in your life beforehand can mitigate great damage.
  ReFuture: Your belief systems will be challenged greatly and you will feel a great
    shift within yourself. Allow it to happen, for any resistance is futile.
