  meaning: Meaning:The Empress is traditionally associated with maternal influence,
    it is the card if you are hoping to start a family. She can represent the creation
    of life, romance, art, or new business.
  upright: "Upright: (Pregnancy, Nurturing, Abundance, Maternal care, A new opportunity,
    Stability) \r\nHistory:\r\nWhen The Empress appears the message is the same, you
    should embrace your softer side, allow yourself to explore the emotions you are
    feeling and listen to your intuition. People will be drawn to you, especially
    those in need of the empathy, compassion and nurturing you are able to provide.For
    those trying to decide on a career or thinking of changing career, it is usually
    an indicator that you would do well in a creative field such as the Arts. Financially
    speaking this is a good time for cash flow. \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed: (Financial issues, Stagnation, Domestic problems, Unwanted
    pregnancy)\r\nHistory:\r\nYou may be focusing too much on the material and mental
    aspects of life, rather than the emotional and spiritual when this Major Arcana
    card appears. The disharmony indicated by The Empress reversed can take many forms.
    You may be putting others' needs before your own to your detriment. Or you may
    feel so emotionally overwhelmed that you are neglecting those that are important
    to you. You may also feel unattractive and undesirable and your confidence has
    taken a knock. You will need to shift the focus and ground yourself to correct
    this imbalance. It can be a signifier of empty-nest syndrome for the parents of
    grown up children. \r\n"
