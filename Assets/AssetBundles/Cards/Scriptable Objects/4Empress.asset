  meaning: Meaning:The Empress is traditionally associated with maternal influence,
    it is the card if you are hoping to start a family. She can represent the creation
    of life, romance, art, or new business.
  upright: "Upright: (Pregnancy, Nurturing, Abundance, Maternal care, A new opportunity,
    Stability) \r\nHistory:\r\nWhen The Empress appears the message is the same, you
    should embrace your softer side, allow yourself to explore the emotions you are
    feeling and listen to your intuition. People will be drawn to you, especially
    those in need of the empathy, compassion and nurturing you are able to provide.For
    those trying to decide on a career or thinking of changing career, it is usually
    an indicator that you would do well in a creative field such as the Arts. Financially
    speaking this is a good time for cash flow. \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed: (Financial issues, Stagnation, Domestic problems, Unwanted
    pregnancy)\r\nHistory:\r\nYou may be focusing too much on the material and mental
    aspects of life, rather than the emotional and spiritual when this Major Arcana
    card appears. The disharmony indicated by The Empress reversed can take many forms.
    You may be putting others' needs before your own to your detriment. Or you may
    feel so emotionally overwhelmed that you are neglecting those that are important
    to you. You may also feel unattractive and undesirable and your confidence has
    taken a knock. You will need to shift the focus and ground yourself to correct
    this imbalance. It can be a signifier of empty-nest syndrome for the parents of
    grown up children. \r\n"
  Past: "It seems you\u2019ve always had a close bond to mother earth. Even as a child,
    Nature is where you felt most at peace. "
  Present: I sense a surge of creativity brewing in you. The world is your canvas,
    let loose and paint it.
  Future: I see a child in your future and you are a very proud parent. Trust me,
    hips don't lie
  RePast: As a child you relied too heavily on your family and friends, this has caused
    your personal growth to stagnate. You must become more independent if you wish
    to succeed.
  RePresent: Your friends and family can always rely on you to help them in dire circumstances.
    While this is a noble trait to have, make sure not to neglect your own needs.
  ReFuture: "It\u2019s very hard to read your future, there is a huge wall blocking
    it\u2019s path. You need to push past this blockade otherwise your future will
    be dull."
