  meaning: "Meaning: The World represents an ending to a cycle of life, a pause in
    life before the next big cycle beginning with the fool. It is an indicator of
    a major and inexorable change, of tectonic breadth.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Successful conclusions, Possibilities, Fulfillment, Achievement)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe
    World can also mean you will have the world at your feet in another sense, i.e.
    that you will be successful and the opportunities available to you at the moment
    are endless. You have gone through the trials and tribulations of the rest of
    the Major Arcana, you have endured the hardships and learned your lessons and
    now you will reap the rewards. You should be proud of what you have achieved,
    it has not been easy to get here but you\u2019ve done it. The universe is smiling
    upon you and luck is on your side when this Major Arcana card appears in your
    reading so grab the opportunities available to you. \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Delayed success, Lack of completion, Stagnation, Failed plans)\r\nHistory:\r\nYou
    may have tried to take shortcuts instead of putting in the hard work necessary
    to achieve your dreams. You may be throwing all your energy into trying to make
    something work that is not working for you. The World reversed can signify feeling
    stuck in a situation. This will be one particular part of your life that is taking
    up your energy rather than problems in all areas. You may be aware of what is
    it already as it will be a focus for you and you may feel burdened by it. Remember
    that there is no point in flogging a dead horse. So if you\u2019ve thrown everything
    you\u2019ve got something and it\u2019s still not working for you, The World reversed
    may be telling you that it\u2019s time to accept the disappointment and cut your
    losses. \r\n\r\n"
  Past: 'You were a good kid, always doing your homework on time. Maintaining good
    habits should always be a priority. '
  Present: Always the completionist, you make sure to see every decision through to
    the end.
  Future: "You have accomplished a great many things and you don\u2019t seem to be
    slowing down. Before going off on another life changing journey, perhaps some
    vacation is in order."
  RePast: You always searched for the easy way out. Careful to look before you leap,
    or your short-cut might lead to a dead end.
  RePresent: "Procrastination is not a cute look. Beware the notion of \u201CI\u2019ll
    do it later\u201D\r\n"
  ReFuture: You seek solid answers where there are none. It will do you some good
    to embrace uncertainty.
