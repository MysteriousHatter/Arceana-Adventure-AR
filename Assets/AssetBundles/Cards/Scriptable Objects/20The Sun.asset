  upright: "Upright:(Joy, Enlightenment, Material happiness, Marriage, Success, Vitality)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe
    Sun Tarot card is the Major Arcana card of positivity, optimism, freedom and fun.
    When The Sun appears in an upright position, things should be going well for you
    as this card also represents success and enthusiasm. You will find that people
    are drawn to the happy vibes and positive energy you are giving out and you will
    bring light and joy to everyone and everything you come into contact with. You
    will be feeling carefree, liberated and self-assured. It is also the card of truth
    so if you have been the victim of lies or deception, The Sun is coming to shine
    its light on the deceit to reveal the truth and the perpetrators of the lies.
    The Sun Tarot card in an upright position also signifies good luck. Any problems
    you have been experiencing will melt away with the warmth this card brings. It
    can also indicate travel to a country with a warm climate.\r\n\r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(False impressions, Lack of clarity, Low Vitality, Sadness)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe
    Sun reversed does not usually mean that your situation or circumstances are all
    that bad but that you are feeling pessimistic and focusing on the negative which
    is affecting your outlook on life. It can signify a lack of enthusiasm for life,
    being unclear on the right path to take or being unable to see the way forward.
    This Major Arcana card may show that you are letting negative energy/thoughts
    close you off to the happiness and joy that is all around you. You have the power
    to change this by simply allowing yourself to be open to the positive things that
    are coming your way and by finding gratitude for the good things in your life.
    \ The Sun reversed can also be an indicator of being overly enthusiastic or confident
    to the point that it becomes a negative trait.\r\n"
