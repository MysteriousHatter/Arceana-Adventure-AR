  upright: "Upright:( Overcoming obstacles, Will power, Drive, A journey, Confidence,
    Ambition)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe Chariot Tarot represents overcoming obstacles through
    determination, focus and willpower. You will be feeling motivated, ambitious and
    in control. Now is a time to go for what you really want. The Chariot is not without
    its challenges, there may be many obstacles in your path but if you stay focused,
    keep your composure and are confident in your abilities, you will be successful!The
    Chariot can also indicate that you may be acting defensively or aggressively to
    hide that you are feeling emotionally vulnerable. The Chariot represents finding
    the balance between the heart and mind. Put any worries aside and maintain your
    focus.\r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Scattered energy, Lack of direction, Self doubt)\r\nHistory:\r\n\u200B\r\nThe
    Chariot Tarot card reversed can indicate that you feel powerless and are lacking
    direction. You need to take control of your own destiny and not let outside forces
    determine your path. You need to regain your drive and determination. Consider
    what aspects of your current situation are within your control and take proactive
    steps to change your fate. You may be powerless, lacking in confidence and put
    upon by others or by the circumstances of your life. This may be leading to anger,
    frustration and uncontrolled aggression. If the people in your life are being
    too needy and demanding you need to take back your power in a productive way.
    Be clear about what time or resources you are prepared to dedicate to others.
    Set your boundaries and stick to them.\r\n"

  RePast: "You are in a serious rut and don\u2019t know where to take your life. Here\u2019s
    a word of advice, get out more. Go into the world and try something new, the worst
    that can happen is that you don\u2019t like the new experience. As they say the
    only way to know where to go in life is to know where you don\u2019t want to go. "
  RePresent: 'There are two types of people in the world, those who support you and
    those who oppose you. Crush the opposition and prove them wrong by being as successful
    as possible. '
  ReFuture: "Procrastination is like a dragon that stole your productivity and now
    holds it atop an unnecessarily tall tower. Wield your self-discipline like an
    unyielding sword, slay the dragon, and regain your productivity! \r\n"
