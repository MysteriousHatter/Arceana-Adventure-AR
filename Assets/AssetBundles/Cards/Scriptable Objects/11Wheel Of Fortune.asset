  meaning: "Meaning: A common aspect to most interpretations of this card within a
    reading is to introduce an element of change in the querent's life, such change
    being in station, position or fortune: such as the rich becoming poor, or the
    poor becoming rich.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Changes, Opportunity, Luck, Destiny, Winning, Chance)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe
    Wheel of Fortune is generally an indicator of luck or destiny and it is a Major
    Arcana signifier of change. When the Wheel of Fortune appears upright in your
    Tarot reading big changes are coming. These changes should be for your greater
    good, but remember not all change is easy even if it\u2019s leading you to your
    destiny! The upright Wheel of Fortune signals that the universe is working in
    your favour to help you reach your goals. Make sure you make the most of this
    time by focusing your intention on what you truly want! Know that the universe
    has a plan for you even if that plan is not clear to you at this point. \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Mishap, Unforeseen setback, Bad luck, Misfortune, Disappointment)\r\nHistory:\r\n\r\nThe
    reversed Wheel of Fortune is a strong indicator that there is a challenging time
    ahead and that the change coming may be difficult to adjust to. It can represent
    that things had been going well and have suddenly and quite unexpectedly fallen
    apart. This sudden deterioration can leave you feeling powerless, out of control
    and as if external forces are working against you. However, that is not the case.
    While there may be some outside factors, the current situation is most likely
    a result of decisions you made. You will need to take control of your situation
    and ownership of your choices in order to learn from this situation. \r\n"
  Past: Ever since you were little you knew you were destined for greatness! Now if
    only you knew what that destiny entailed.
  Present: 'Pick up a four-leaf clover? See a ladybug flying by? Keep seeing the number
    seven everywhere you go? My dude you should go and buy a lottery ticket asap.
    Good luck like this is fickle and fleeting, so use it while you can! '
  Future: You may be in the slumps right now but worry not! A turning point is just
    around the bend, so push through to reap the reward.
  RePast: 'If you continue to be stuck in the past you will never see your future.
    Throw away the chains holding you back and embrace what the future has to offer
    you. '
  RePresent: "See a black cat crossing the street? Broke a mirror? Walked under an
    open ladder? Yikes! My dude you have what we call bad luck. Better stay in for
    the day. It\u2019ll limit the inevitable fallout."
  ReFuture: "It\u2019s time for a change of pace, you have accomplished so much but
    are starting to lose steam. Break your daily routine to reinvigorate yourself!"
