  meaning: 'Meaning: This card is suggestive of stability and security in life. You
    are on top of things and everything is under your control. It is your hard work,
    discipline and self control that have bought you this far. It means that you are
    in charge of your life now setting up your own rules and boundaries.'
  upright: "Upright:(Law and order, Power, Leadership, Father figure, Promotion, Authority)\r\nHistory:\r\nIf
    The Emperor Tarot card appears in a past position, this Major Arcana card can
    indicate that the father figure in your life was authoritarian and that, while
    he had your best interests at heart, he may have struggled to show affection.
    If it appears in the present or future it\u2019s a much better omen as it indicates
    a wise older man who will give you solid advice which, if you follow it, will
    lead you in the right direction. Generally, if not representing a person in your
    life, The Emperor signifies the dominance of logic over emotion and of the mind
    over the heart. It signifies that concentration, structure, stability and focus
    is required if you want to make your ideas and dreams a reality. The Emperor upright
    can represent fatherhood.\r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Loss of authority, Immaturity, Control freak, Lack of discipline,
    Manipulative friends)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe Emperor in reverse as a person signifies
    an older man or person in authority in your life who may be abusing his power
    or being too authoritarian leaving you feeling powerless or rebellious. This person
    may actually be trying to give you solid guidance but the message is lost due
    to their domineering behaviour. The best way to handle this person is to remain
    calm and logical. Take the advice that works for you and throw the rest away.
    Don\u2019t be afraid to stand up to authority but do so in a practical and logical
    manner which will get you the results you want. The Emperor reversed can also
    indicate a father figure who let you down or abandoned you. \r\n"
