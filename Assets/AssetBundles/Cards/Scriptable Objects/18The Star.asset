  meaning: "Meaning: When the Star card appears, you are likely to find yourself feeling
    inspired. It brings renewed hope and faith and a sense that you are truly blessed
    by the universe at this time.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Good health, Opportunities, Spirituality, Astronomy, Inspiration,
    Hope)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe Star is a very positive omen. It is the period of calm
    and stability that follows the storm that was The Tower. The Star indicates that
    you have come through your tough times with a renewed sense of yourself and the
    world around you, you are full of calm, well-balanced energy and you are open
    to healing the wounds of the past. Whatever mental, emotional, physical or spiritual
    issues you were experiencing are now behind you and you are ready to embrace what
    your future holds. Trust that the universe has a plan for you and trust the feeling
    you have that everything is going to be OK.  You will be feeling confident in
    yourself and people will like you for who you are with this card in your Tarot
    reading. The Star can also indicate creativity and artistic flair, so now would
    be a great time to take up an artistic hobby.\r\n\r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Despair, Missed opportunities, Disappointments, Illness)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe
    Star can signify that you have lost your confidence, your belief in yourself and
    your trust in your own abilities. This Major Arcana card can also be an indication
    of feeling anxious and overwhelmed. A change of attitude is needed to resolve
    this not necessarily a change of circumstances. Don\u2019t allow yourself to continue
    to play the victim if you have long since left the situation in which you were
    victimised. The Star is telling you that it\u2019s time to heal the past, draw
    a line under it and move forward. Seek support to do this if you need to. You
    can do anything you set your mind to, you just have to believe in yourself and
    focus on the positive. Start small and try to find one or two things to be grateful
    for in each day. A creative outlet might also be helpful to you if you are artistically
    inclined. Rediscover your creative side, it will help you heal.\r\n"
  Past: Much like picking up an unfinished game, you will find yourself reinvigorated
    to pick up unfinished activities that were casted to the wayside.
  Present: Look at you all bright eyed and bushy tailed, just hopping with hope that
    today will be a good day.
  Future: "Faith, trust, and pixie dust. Sometimes all you can do is have faith it\u2019ll
    all work out."
  RePast: "Like a computer that has been unplugged, you feel disconnected from the
    world around you and the people in it. It may be best to surround yourself with
    trusted loved ones, they\u2019ll help plug you back in."
  RePresent: "Have faith in the people around you, they aren\u2019t as incompetenct
    as you may think they are."
  ReFuture: "Don\u2019t lose heart being stuck at a roadblock. Trust that you will
    find a way through. "
