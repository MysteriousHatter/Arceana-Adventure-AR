  meaning: "Meaning: Strength predicts the triumphant conclusion to a major life problem,
    situation or temptation through strength of character. It is a very happy card
    if you are fighting illness or recovering from injury.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Virility, Inner strength, Potency, Vitality, Confidence, Self-belief,
    Enjoying power)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe Strength Tarot card is the Major Arcana card
    of inner strength. It represents mastering raw emotions in order to bring calm
    to yourself or a situation. It is similar to the Chariot in that it represents
    overcoming challenges. However, the Strength card usually refers to inner challenges.
    Overcoming the obstacles we face in relation to our own doubts, fears and anxieties.
    In a general context this card indicates that you are learning to master your
    fears and anxieties, to be courageous and daring. You have all the skills you
    need to be successful, the focus now is to conquer your inner worries and believe
    in yourself. \u200B\r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Hedonism, Self-doubt, Lacking courage, Lack of self-control,
    Vanity)\r\nHistory:\r\nWhen the Strength Tarot card appears reversed in your Tarot
    reading, it indicates that you are not tapping into the inner strength you have.
    It does not indicate a lack of strength so much as it indicates that you are letting
    fear, anxiety or low self-esteem paralyse you. Now more than ever you need to
    summon your inner resolve and self-belief to pull you out of your current situation.
    You have the strength you need to get over your obstacles. You have simply lost
    touch with it and that disconnection is leaving you feeling weak, vulnerable and
    lacking confidence. Focus on the positive, stay away from people who make you
    feel inadequate and spend time with people who build you up. \r\n"
  Past: 'You are a master of persuasion, it must be thanks to all those Halloween
    nights spent bartering almond joys for kit kats. Your child self would be proud. '
  Present: "Though it doesn\u2019t seem like it, being kind takes more strength than
    people are willing to admit. Stay strong in the face of adversary and continue
    to seek strength in being kind to others."
  Future: Like a stone being dropped into a pond, take care to consider your words
    before you speak, you never know who they might influence.
  RePast: As the saying goes, when life throws you a curveball, pull yourself up by
    your bootstraps. You are stronger than you know, so give yourself some more credit.
  RePresent: "Your emotions ring raw and wild like a lion\u2019s roar. Be careful
    you don\u2019t accidentally catch innocent bystanders in the line of fire. "
  ReFuture: 'If self-doubt is allowed to fester, it will grow on you like a bad mosquito
    bite that you insist on scratching. Wear confidence like bug repellent to keep
    the doubt at bay. '
