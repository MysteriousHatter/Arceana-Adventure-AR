    a counsellor or mentor who will provide you with wisdom and guidance or a spiritual
    or religious advisor such as a priest, vicar, preacher, imam, rabbi or a monk.

    The institutions The Hierophant Tarot card can represent include economic, religious,
    political, social, family, educational, social welfare and medical. Its appearance
    can signify that now is a time to conform to convention or tradition. It\u2019s
    not a time to rock the boat. It can also be an indicator that you will take part
    in some sort of traditional ceremony or that you may start creating some new traditions
    or rituals of your own.\r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Breakdown, Rejection of family values, Abuse of position,
    Poor counsel)\r\nHistory:\r\nWhen The Hierophant Tarot appears reversed it is
    time to break with convention. You will want to change traditional structure,
    social norms and rigid rules. Those close to you may not understand this need
    to challenge the established way of doing things and may be completely against
    it but you will feel compelled to think for yourself and throw away the rule book.
    The Hierophant reversed can signify an unconventional way of living or an alternative
    lifestyle\r\n"
  Past: You were a good little child, always keeping up with your studies and eager
    to learn.
  Present: Like a mod for a christian minecraft server, you are a pillar for those
    seeking spiritual wisdom.
  Future: I see a bright torch being passed down to you from your parents. You are
    going to carry it proudly, keeping everything in your family tradition.
  RePast: When you were younger, you felt like you were alone and had no one to turn
    to. So you turned to yourself, letting no one else in.
  RePresent: You are an individual thinker. Believing in no higher power and praying
    to only yourself.
  ReFuture: "I would give you more words of advice, but you don\u2019t believe in
    fate let alone the tarot deck."
