    Poor counsel)\r\nHistory:\r\nWhen The Hierophant Tarot appears reversed it is
    time to break with convention. You will want to change traditional structure,
    social norms and rigid rules. Those close to you may not understand this need
    to challenge the established way of doing things and may be completely against
    it but you will feel compelled to think for yourself and throw away the rule book.
    The Hierophant reversed can signify an unconventional way of living or an alternative
    lifestyle\r\n"
