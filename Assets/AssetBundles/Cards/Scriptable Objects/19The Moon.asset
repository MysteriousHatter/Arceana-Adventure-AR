  meaning: "Meaning: The Moon is a card of illusion and deception, and therefore often
    suggests a time when something is not as it appears to be. Perhaps a misunderstanding
    on your part, or a truth you cannot admit to yourself.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Difficult period, Insecurity, Mental confusion, Deception, Hidden
    things, Fear)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe Moons tells you that something about a situation
    or person in your life is not what it appears to be and you need to trust what
    your instincts are telling you in order to see past this illusion. The Moon also
    indicates that you should pay attention to your dreams as your subconscious may
    be bringing your attention to some information you\u2019ve missed. The Moon can
    also signify that you are letting your anxiety or fear overwhelm you which may
    be having a negative effect on your outlook and causing you to suffer from mood
    swings, instability or insecurity. It can also represent a woman\u2019s menstrual
    cycle. The Moon can also signify dormant insecurities or repressed issues resurfacing.
    The Moon Tarot card can represent underhanded or dodgy deals or illegal behaviour.
    If it appears in this context it is a warning to clean your act up before your
    behaviour is exposed. \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Unhappiness, Release of fear, Insomnia, Unusual dreams, Mysteries
    unveiled)\r\nHistory:\r\nThis Major Arcana card may also be an indication of self-deception
    or delusions. You may be kidding yourself about your role in creating your current
    circumstances or you may be struggling to separate your own deception or fantasies
    from reality. The Moon reversed can also indicate that any depression or mental
    health issues you have been having will begin to lift and you will begin to see
    the light again. You will work through any repressed issues or insecurities to
    find new confidence and clarity. If you have been awaiting a decision on something,
    The Moon reversed indicates that you will get an answer or clarity on the matter.\r\n"
  Past: "I see something traumatic has happened in your past that causes you much
    distress. Ensure that distress doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome. "
  Present: Impulsive decisions may look cool in the movies but I can assure you, they
    are not. Do not let false pretences sway you from seeking the truth.
  Future: 'Though life is fickle and unsure, listen to your inner voice, it will guide
    you to self enlightenment. '
  RePast: "As a child you were bound by your parent\u2019s belief system. As an adult,
    free yourself from such beliefs and see the world with open eyes."
  RePresent: Mid-life crisis? Join the club. Who even knows what anyone is supposed
    to do with themselves anymore. Maybe some soul searching is in order.
  ReFuture: 'You did it, like a mighty knight conquering the dragon, you have conquered
    your fears. Now go get your princess before the dragon wakes up. '
