    the outcome you want. If it is referring to other people in your life it usually

    intentions)\r\nHistory:\r\nA person in your life who presents themselves as knowledgeable
    and trustworthy may actually be trying to use you or manipulate you.It can also
    indicate that partner/lover who appears to be trustworthy, may be using their
    influence over you to manipulate you for their own selfish reasons. The Magician

    a new venture because you are unsure you can trust the other people involved,

    in a financial rut you will need to take a proactive approach to change your circumstances.\r\n"
