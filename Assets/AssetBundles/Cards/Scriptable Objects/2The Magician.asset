    the outcome you want. If it is referring to other people in your life it usually
    refers to someone you can learn from whose ability and wisdom will impress you.If

    new. Your partner will be serious about you, has good intentions and will treat
    you well.You might be presented with an opportunity to mentor someone or be mentored

    intentions)\r\nHistory:\r\nA person in your life who presents themselves as knowledgeable
    and trustworthy may actually be trying to use you or manipulate you.It can also
    indicate that partner/lover who appears to be trustworthy, may be using their
    influence over you to manipulate you for their own selfish reasons. The Magician
    reversed can indicate deceitful people around you so if you are holding back on
    a new venture because you are unsure you can trust the other people involved,
    this may be an indicator that you are right to be concerned. If you are stuck
    in a financial rut you will need to take a proactive approach to change your circumstances.\r\n"
