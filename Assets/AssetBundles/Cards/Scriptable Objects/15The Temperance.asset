  meaning: 'Meaning: This card indicates that you should learn to bring about balance,
    patience and moderation in your life. You should take the middle road, avoiding
    extremes and maintain a sense of calm.'
  upright: "Upright:(Connecting with your guides, Balance, Moderation, Harmony, Alchemy,
    Looking for divine intervention)\r\nHistory:\r\nYou have learned not to allow
    yourself to be dragged into other people\u2019s conflict or to let minor issues
    knock you off balance. Instead you adapt to the situations with a clear mind and
    calm heart and keep your balance. Temperance can also signify that you have found
    peace and tranquillity and you are feeling content. Temperance indicates that
    you are truly in touch with who you are inside, what you value and your own moral
    compass and you are finding it easier to figure out your aspirations and set yourself
    goals. \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:Disharmony, Imbalance, Onset of illness, Lack of patience\r\nHistory:\r\nThe
    Temperance Tarot card in a reversed position may be telling you that you have
    lost touch with your own inner calm and tranquillity which can lead you to seek
    gratification in risky, harmful ways. Temperance reversed can also indicate a
    lack of harmony with the people in your life so you may find yourself clashing
    with those closest to you or allowing yourself to be dragged into other people\u2019s
    drama. You may be lacking perspective and not looking at the bigger picture. You
    would do well to take a step back and take a look at how you are behaving, examine
    the root causes and work on resolving them.\r\n"
