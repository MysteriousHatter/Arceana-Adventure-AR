  meaning: "Meaning: It represents being seduced by the material world and physical
    pleasures. Also living in fear, domination and bondage, being caged by an overabundance
    of luxury, discretion should be used in personal and business matters.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Temptation, Unhealthy relationships, Enslavement, Materialism,
    Bondage, Fear, Feeling trapped)\r\nHistory:\r\n\r\nWith this Major Arcana card
    in your Tarot spread you may feel as though outside influences or forces beyond
    your control are restricting you, leaving you feeling powerless and victimised.
    However, this is the illusion The Devil creates. You are in control of your own
    destiny and are not bound by anything other than your own attitudes and behaviour.
    Don\u2019t give up and don\u2019t give away your power. You don\u2019t have to
    tolerate negativity, criticism, manipulation or abuse from anyone. There are always
    options and there is always something positive you can do to improve your situation
    no matter how hopeless things may seem on the surface.out of control. \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Freedom from restraints, Breaking from addictions, Divorce)\r\nHistory:\r\nYou
    want to be free from these problems and you are starting to get the motivation
    to change your circumstances. It can also indicate that you are getting a new
    perspective on issues that you felt powerless to change previously. The changes
    you want to make may not be easy but they are necessary for you if you want to
    have a happy life in the future and you are beginning to realise what you have
    to do. The Devil Tarot card reversed can also indicate a near miss with a negative,
    harmful or dangerous situation or person. The important message this Major Arcana
    card brings is to be grateful that you avoided it, learn from it and move forward.
    Do not fall back into the old bad or risky behaviours that led you so close to
    danger. Don\u2019t get cocky and think you are invincible if you managed to dodge
    the bullet. Appreciate your good fortune, but don\u2019t push it!\r\n"
