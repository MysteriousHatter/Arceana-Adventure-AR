  meaning: "Meaning: The Hanged Man is the card that suggests ultimate surrender,
    sacrifice, or being suspended in time.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Letting go, Breaking old patterns, Circumspection, Suspension,
    Metamorphosis)\r\nHistory:\r\nThe Hanged Man tarot card indicates that you are
    in a situation that you are unhappy with. You may be feeling like you are stuck
    in a rut or trapped in a situation or frame of mind that is not making you happy
    but you have the power to release yourself. This may involve walking away from
    the situation or simply changing your perspective on it. \r\nYou need to step
    outside yourself and look at your situation from a different angle. Give yourself
    time to just relax, stop trying to control things and just let them be, the correct
    course of action will become clear to you in time.\r"
  downright: "Reversed:(Missing an opportunity, Inability to change, Egotism)\r\nHistory:\r\n\u200B\r\nThe
    Hanged Man reversed can indicate that you are being impulsive and making rash
    decisions as a way to distract yourself from some sort of inner discontentment.
    This Major Arcana trump card generally shows that you may be jumping from one
    bad situation to the next without considering where this behaviour is taking you.
    Ask yourself if there are feelings you trying to avoid confronting or changes
    that you know need to be made but are reluctant to tackle. If there are, consider
    what you fear will happen if you do? If you genuinely don\u2019t know what to
    do in terms of your direction in life, just stop, breathe and wait for things
    to become clearer. However, if you know your behaviour patterns are not working
    for you, change them. Your attitude towards your life will determine life\u2019s
    attitude towards you!\r\n"
