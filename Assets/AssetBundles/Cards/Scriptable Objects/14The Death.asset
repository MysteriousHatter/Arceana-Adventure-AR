  meaning: "Meaning: Unlikely that this card actually represents a physical death.
    Typically it implies an end, possibly of a relationship or interest, and therefore
    implies an increased sense of self-awareness.\r\n"
  upright: "Upright:(Endings, Severe illness, Profound change, Letting go of attachments,
    Failure, Mortality)\r\nHistory:\r\nAs a rule you should never predict deaths (or
    the outcomes of illnesses or pregnancies for that matter) as a Tarot reader. It
    is unethical and irresponsible. Aside from the ethics, The Death Tarot Card usually
    signifies spiritual transformation and a time of change and new beginnings, not
    actual death! The transformation or change that Death can bring can be difficult,
    unexpected, sudden or even traumatic but it will bring with it a new lease of
    life. Its best to try not to resist the change the Death Tarot card brings as
    resisting it will only make the transition difficult and painful. Instead try
    to embrace the change as a fresh start. \r\n"
  downright: "Reversed:(Living unaware, Depression, Long terminal illness, Resistance
    to change, Delayed endings)\r\nHistory:\r\nNothing new can begin while you are
    holding on to this old negative energy. Death indicates that while you are finding
    it difficult to let go, once you do, new energy will come into your life to give
    you a new brighter beginning. The change the Death Tarot card reversed brings
    is not something you can resist forever, if you keep holding onto the things you
    should be letting go of, the universe will find a way to push you on to your life
    path in its own way. The universe\u2019s way of getting you to where you\u2019re
    supposed to be, if you resist it, can be shocking and distressing. It\u2019s much
    better to make your way to your correct path rather than getting a jolt that forces
    you onto it. \r\n"
